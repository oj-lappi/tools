We should use a socket to talk to i3, a la https://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html
That socket sets an i3 variable
Then we can use the change_to_spawn_dir script to change the working directory of the terminal at spawn-time


In fact, IF possible, we might even be able to chagne the working directory of i3, which should change the wd of all subprocesses (including terminals)
IFF this last option is possible, it is the cleanest
