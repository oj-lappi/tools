# Tools

This repo contains some convenience CLI-tools I've written

## pdf_watch

Watches files and compiles latex into pdf. Depends on (at least) pdflatex and entr.

## comic_make

Makes .cbz's out of folders of images.

## screenrecord

Records an X11-display and alsa device to make a video. Depends on ffmpeg.

## watch_random

Watch random videos in any amount of windows, good for vjing. Depends on vlc

## view_random

Same as above but for images. Depends on feh.

These last two use & to run in the background, which in vlc's case will leave the actual program (and the video audio) running in the background after you close the windows.
